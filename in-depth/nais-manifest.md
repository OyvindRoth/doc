# The NAIS manifest

The NAIS manifest `nais.yaml` describes your application. You can see a minimal example manifest at the bottom.

Here you can find all the supported fields for the manifest.

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |

| metadata.namespace | Which namespace the application will be deployed to |  | x |
| metadata.labels.team | [mailnick/tag](../basics/teams.md) |  | x |
| spec.image | Docker image location, including version |  | x |
| spec.port | The HTTP port exposed by the container | 8080 |  |
| spec.strategy.type | Specifies the strategy used to replace old Pods by new ones | RollingUpdate |  |
| spec.liveness.path | Path of the [liveness probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/) |  | x |

| spec.liveness.periodSeconds | How often \(in seconds\) to perform the probe | 10 |  |
| spec.liveness.failureThreshold | When a Pod starts and the probe fails, Kubernetes will try `failureThreshold` times before giving up. Giving up in case of liveness probe means restarting the Pod. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked Unready | 3 |  |

| spec.readiness.timeout | Number of seconds after which the probe times out | 1 |  |
| spec.replicas.min | Minimum number of replicas | 2 |  |
| spec.replicas.max | Maximum number of replicas | 4 |  |
| spec.cpuThresholdPercentage | Total CPU percentage threshold on deployment, at which point it will increase number of pods if `current < max`. See [container lifecycle hooks documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/) |  |  |

| spec.configMaps.files | List of ConfigMap resources that will have their contents mounted into the container as files. Files appear as `/var/run/configmaps/<name>/<key>`. |  |  |

## Default environment variables

These environment variables will be injected into your application container

| variable | example | source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NAIS\_APP\_NAME | myapp | metadata.name from nais.yaml |
| NAIS\_NAMESPACE | default | metadata.namespace from nais.yaml |
| NAIS\_APP\_IMAGE | navikt/myapp:69 | spec.image from nais.yaml |
| NAIS\_CLUSTER\_NAME | prod-fss | naiserator runtime context |
